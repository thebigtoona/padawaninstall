# Install Helper for Padawan 

## Things to Note

* Only working for linux right now.  Need to change a couple of things for a Mac OS env, and test on Mac OS
* The script is still very basic and needs a lot of adjustment.  It won't catch every exception or error at this time 
* The script runs your docker containers detached but you can see if they're running by using `docker ps`

## Installation

1. clone the repo to wherever you keep your scripts  

## Usage 

1. create a directory to keep all the padawan files in 
2. from the terminal `bash /path/to/script/padawaninstalls/install_script.sh /path/to/your/created/directory` (NO SLASH AT THE END)
